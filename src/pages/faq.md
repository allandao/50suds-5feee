      - question: How long does shipping take?
        answer: >
          Shipping is based on when your order is received. We currently only
          ship our soaps within the state they are made for.


          *   US shipping within the state of Michigan will take between 3 to 5
          business days.
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >
          *   All items sales on our website, Etsy, or any other of our digital
          platforms are final.


          *   If you purchased our soap in-person, please refer to the store's
          policies.
